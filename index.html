<h3>Hitchens was developed as an alternate solution to bots common to DalNET. Two particular issues were addressed.</h3>
<ol>
<li>Timed bans</li>
<p>Many times the intent of a ban is a timeout rather than a long lived ban that might be more appropriate as an akick.
An easy way to set a 10 minute ban or a 1 day ban seems more applicable to most bans.</p>

<li>Talkative bots</li>
<p>A common feature of bots is being talkative in a channel like a regular user would be. Bots that talk unprompted got booted very quickly.
Hitchens never messages unless prompted to do so.</p>
</ol>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>All commands to the bot start with '.' This is to make mobile usage easier and to use a character not often starting a normal message.</p>
<ol>
<li>Timed bans</li>

<p>A timed ban handles natural language specifications of times in the future.<p>

<quote>
<pre>
Examples:

.ban nick (bans 'nick' for 1 day)
.ban nick 10 minutes (bans 'nick' for 10 minutes)
.ban nick until Monday [on Saturday at 6:00pm PST] (bans until the next Monday at 6:00pm PST)
</pre>
</quote>


<p>A list of the existing bans can be seen with .bl n.b. working on getting SOP list for .bc which clears the existing bans managed by the bot.<p>

<p><b>If a natural language specification doesn't work please let me know.</b></p>

<li>Link handling</li>

<p>Hitchens can handle most links that have a title tag, Hitchens has YouTube and Twitter handling using their API's for deeper link handling. All clickable links posted to the channel will automatically be processed. Links that do not start with http or https are not handled.</p>

<li>Dictionary lookup</li>

<p>Hitchens does dictionary lookups using the Oxford Dictionary API. Dictionary lookups are handled with .define <i>word</i></p>

<quote>
<pre>
Examples:

.define eloquent ->
<Hitchens> fluent or persuasive in speaking or writing
</pre>
</quote>

<li>Urban Dictionary</i>

<p>Hitchens uses the Urban Dictionary API to get the most "liked" definition for a word or phrase. Urban Dictionary lookups are handling with .ud <i>word or phrase</i></p>

<quote>
<pre>
Examples:

.ud quiet -> 
<Hitchens> 1) Containing little noise, but not [silence].,,2) The state of little sound.,,3) To lower [something's] (usually [the voice's]) sound.

.ud turn the other cheek ->
<Hitchens> [Turn the other cheek] is a famous phrase taken from the [Sermon on the Mount] in the Christian New Testament. This passage is viewed as promoting nonresistance, [pacifism] or nonviolence.,,

<p>n.b. some results may be offensive or not safe for work since they are user submitted and voted up.</p>

<li>Dice roll</li>

<p>Hitchens will roll up to 999 dice of sides 999. Dice rolls are specified by .dice or .roll followed by a [1-999]d[1-999]</p>

<quote>
<pre>
Examples:

.roll 2d6 (rolls a 6 sided die twice) ->
 <Hitchens> Total: 12

<li>Auto bans</li>

<p>Hitchens only auto-bans, for 10 minutes, two words; the n-word and butthead. The latter is for testing without having to type the n-word.</p>

<li>Dante Inferno</li>

<p>Hitchens will select a random stanza from Dante's inferno and message it to the channel. The command is .dante</p>

<quote>
<pre>
Examples:

.dante ->
<Hitchens> Ma ne l’ultima bolgia de le diece | me per l’alchìmia che nel mondo usai | dannò Minòs, a cui fallar non lece».
